        <p class="p"> Thermal power stations</p>
        <p class="p"> Classic thermoelectric power plants use the heat that comes from fossil fuels susch as
            coal,natural gas and petroleum derivatives as an energy sources. The fuels is burned in a boiler, generating
            heat energy that is used that circulates through a serie of pipes. This water vapor is what drives the
            blades of the steam turbine, and thus converts heat energy into mechanical energy, wich will then lead to
            the generation of electrical energy in the alternator.</p>

        <p class="p"> A hydroelectric plants is a power plant that use water to generate electricity. Generate
            electricity. The falling water flows through turbine hydraulic causes its axis to rotate and convert the
            potential energy of falling water into mechanical energy. In turn, the turbine shaft is connected to the
            alternator, therefore it is called an alternator and transmits its rotational mechanical energy, converted

            <p class="p"> Photovoltaic power plants are renewable and clean energy plants that take advantage of solar
                radiation to generate electricity. It is based on the so-called photoelectric effect, by which certain
                materials are able to absorb photons and release electrons, thus producing an electric current.This uses
                semiconductor devices called photovoltaic cells or cells, which can be made of monocrystalline,
                polycrystalline or amorphous silicon or other thin-film semiconductor materials. Monocrystalline silicon
                is obtained from a single crystal of pure silicon.</p>

            <p class="h1"> Nuclear energy and power plants</p>
            <p class="p"> Nuclear energy is the energy contained in the nucleus of an atom. Atoms are the smallest
                smallest particles into which a chemical element can be split while maintaining its properties.
                In the nucleus of each atom there are two types of particles (neutrons and protons) that are held
                together.
                together. Nuclear energy is the energy that holds neutrons and protons together.</p>
            <p class="p"> Nuclear energy can be used to produce electricity. But first the energy must be released.
            </p>
            <p class="p"> When the nuclear reaction occurs, the atoms experience a slight loss of mass. This lost
                mass is converted into a large amount of heat energy and radiation, as Albert Einstein discovered
                with his famous equation E=mc².</p>
            <p class="p">The heat energy produced is used to produce steam and generate electricity with a turbine,

                    that
                    already pollute, because this is being derived worse. Its consequences on the environment are
                    harmful, as it has toxic, mutagenic or carcinogenic properties.</p>

                    fuels and also as a result of certain chemical reactions, this is one of the main gases that
                    produces that pollutes the atmosphere. You could say that carbon dioxide is the main cause of
                    climate change and underground mining, methane gas, which is a potent greenhouse gas.</p>
